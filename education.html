                        There have been multiple challenges throughout the course where 
                        Dr. Angela has asked us to solve problems using the knowledge gained till that particular point in the course, and I have 
                        been able to solve them all independently without having to resort to looking up the solutions from Dr.Angela. 
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        I have also 
                        spent a considerable amount of time to gain extensive knowledge about the under-the-hood mechanisms of basic javascript 
                        async functions, and of frameworks such as react, express, etc. to ensure a deep solid understanding of concepts.
