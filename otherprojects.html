                        <li>
                            The project Edmonton to Gordonvale is a Joint Venture with a budget of $500 million between 
                            John Holland, Seymour Whyte and Aecom. The project scope involves the addition of new lanes to an 
                            existing 10km section of Bruce Highway from Edmonton to Gordonvale, including the construction of 
                            multiple pavements, bridges, cycleways and traffic and road lighting works. It also involved the 
                            relocation of multiple railways (under the jurisdiction of both Queensland Rail and MSF Sugar) 
                            and the installation of new cable routes for Telstra and Reef network.

                            The project has multiple engineering teams based on disciple. The main engineering teams are 
                            the Pavements, Earthworks, Drainage, Structures and Public Utilities. While being on the project, 
                            I have worked in the Pavements team (responsible for monitoring and managing the construction of 
                            the road pavements), Quality Control team (responsible for monitoring that the works done by the 
                            engineers are compliant with the MRTS and other Standards), Public Utilities team (responsible 
                            for managing the construction of water ways, road lighting, traffic signals, field cabinets, 
                            power supply systems and optic fibres, etc.) and the Structures team (responsible for the 
                            construction of multiple new bridges and underpasses) during the duration of the project. I have 
                            experience liaising with multiple subcontractors and stakeholders to make sure that the project 
                            is being completed on time.

                        <li>
                            I have been able to identify multiple major gaps in quality of works done by the different departments 
                            while working in the quality department. Some instance of which are:
                            <br>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    I have been able to identify that the wrong backfill materials were being used as backfill 
                                    for multiple pipes (cement, instead of sand) which could potentially cause damage to the pipes 
                                    as they do not provide the cushioning effect of sand on impact from vehicle loads. I have raised 
                                    this issue with the managers and they have urged the engineers to monitor the quality of works 
                                    more stringently as a result since then. 
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    Till that time in the project, there were issues with using the wrong class of concrete for 
                                    traffic light pole footings and not raising the required Hold Points and Witness Points for the 
                                    works that were done. I have raised this with my seniors, and the importance of raising Hold Points 
                                    before the works commence has been communicated to all the engineers in a toolbox talk.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    The project has a concrete register to keep track of all the concrete pours conducted during the 
                                    project. The register is in an excel file, and has various tabs to keep track of the order numbers, 
                                    pour dates, concrete strength results, etc. Since the original engineer who created the formulae was 
                                    no longer working on the project, and no one else knew how these formulae worked, the formulae in many 
                                    of the cells in the tabs were corrupted and was giving out incorrect information. This incorrect information 
                                    was being used to determine whether to accept or reject the concrete batches used in the project. I have 
                                    utilised my excel knowledge to understand how the formulae worked and have fixed these issues. I have also 
                                    used excel Visual Basic to automate multiple repetitive tasks in the register (and also in other excel registers).

                            For my major Bachelor’s degree final year project, I have analysed the variance of Optimum Moisture Content 
                            (OMC) of clayey soils with the addition of rice husk ash.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            It was found that the curve from the moisture-dry density graph shifts towards the right side as a whole, which 
                            indicates that more moisture is required for the in-situ soil to achieve maximum dry density.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            The practical implication of this result is that the soil is able to accommodate more moisture before maximum dry 
                            density is achieved. This property is extremely useful to strengthen the soil in regions having high in-situ moisture 
                            content, such as regions having high rainfall.

                            I have liaised with the clients, contractors and other team members to put forward a quote for the project, which is 
                            consistent with the scope of work to bid on the tender put forward by the Casey City Council.

                            Out team has identified the relevant works and materials that are needed for the project to be completed on time and 
                            have successfully been able to win the bid for the project because we have been able to identify excessive wasters on site.
